<h3 id="1">Moirai</h3>
<p>In the greek mitology, the moirai (in greek: Μοῖραι) were three sisters who determined the destiny of gods, as well as of the human beings. They are three lugrubrious women, responsable to make, to weave and cut something that would be the thread of life of all individuals. During this work, the moirai make use of the Wheel of Furtune, that is the loom used for weave the thread. The turns of the wheel position the thread of the individual in their more privileged part (the top) or in their less desired part (the  bottom), this way, explaining the phase of good or bad luck for everybody. The three gods decided the individual fate of the ancient greeks, and created Themis, Nemesis and the Erinyes. Belonged to the first generation of gods (the primordials gods), and just like Nix, they ware tamers of gods and humans.</p>

<h3 id="2">Genealogy</h3> 
<p>The moirai were daughters of the Nix the god of the night. Moira, in the singular, was initially the destiny. In the Iliad, it represented a law that hovered above gods ands men, for neither Zeus was authorized to 
transgress it without interfering in the cosmic harmony. In the Odyssey the spinners appear.</p>
<h3 id="3">Influence</h3>
<p>The greek mith prevailed among the Romans to such an extent that the names of the deities fell into disuse. Among them they ware known by Parcas called Nona ("the ninth"), Decima ("the Tenth") and Morta ("the dead one"), which respectively had functions of preside over the gestation and birth, the growth and developments, and the end of life; the death; notice however, that this regency was just "about humans".</p>
<h3 id="4">Characteristics</h3>
<p>The Poets of the antiquity described the moirai as grim-looking maidens, with big teeth and long nails. In the plastic arts, instead, they appear represented as beautiful maidens. They Moirai ware:</p>
